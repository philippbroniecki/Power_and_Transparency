Follow instructions to replicate "Power and Transparency in Political Negotiations"
Note: running all contents of 'master.R' takes 2.4 hours (on i5-8400 @2.8 GHz)
contact philippbroniecki@gmail.com for questions
replication files are also hosted on: https://github.com/philippbroniecki/power_and_transparency

1) open 'master.R'
2) change 'main' to the directory where 'master.R' is located (line 18) 
	(e.g.: main <- 'C:/Users/Philipp/Dropbox/research/papers/Power and Transparency in Political Negotiations/analysis')
3) check the list of required packages and install missing packages with install.packages('name of package'), e.g.: install.packages('Amelia')
	list of required packages:
	- Amelia
	- psych
	- frm
	- Matching
	- MASS
	- gbm
	- dplyr
	- xtable
4) optional: set the number of imputations in 'N_imputations' (line 25) 
	(default = 1000 for replication; e.g.: N_imputations <- 1000)
5) optional: to print latex fonts, set 'latex' to 1 (line 34); (e.g.: latex <- 1)
	instructions for 5) optional: 
	(note that this may not run on Mac)
	- Rtools must be installed (google Rtools)
	- Ghostscript must be installed (google Ghostscript)
	- have R packages: rjson, fontcm and extrafont installed
	- specify ghostscript file path in 'ghostscript.file.path' (line 43); (e.g.: ghostscript.file.path <- 'C:/Program Files/gs/gs9.27/bin/gswin64c.exe')
6) Run lines 47-48 which set the subdirectory structure
7) Run everything in 'sequence' section (lines 53-148)

Directories (folders):
- graphs will be written to 'figures' directory (in pdf format)
- tables will be written to 'tables' directory (in html format)
- 'original data sets' directory contains the data needed for replication (do not change)
- 'scripts' directory contains the R script files that are sourced from 'master.R' (do not change)
- 'work data' directory contains data files generated when the script is first run (can be deleted which requires re-run of 'master.R' script)

Please note that due to the random number generator, replication requires that the progam 'master.R' is run in one go.
